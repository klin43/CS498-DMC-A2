3a) Why do you think the latencies differ? 
I think the latencies between /register and /list differ because /register has to write data to Firestore, which takes longer. I think the region "us-central1" is faster than "europe-west1" because the database (Firestore) is located closer to the US. So, operations from "us-central1" will take less time compared to "europe-west1". 

3b) What does your consistency experiment show?
My consistency experiment shows that all usernames appeared immediately on the other instance (0 missing). This means that Firestore's replication is very fast.
