3a) Why do you think the latencies differ? 
I think the latencies between /register and /list differ because /register has to write data to Firestore, which takes longer than reading data. It is expected that /register endpoint would be slower in both regions (compared to /list) because there are more steps needed. For example, data needs to be written, saved, and validated. The /list endpoint is just reading data and this shows in the output because the latency for reading in both regions is half of the latency for writing in both regions. 
Also, the region makes a difference in latency. "us-central1" is faster than "europe-west1" because the database (Firestore) is located closer to the US. So, when "europe-west1" has an operation, the data needs to travel further, which adds time to every operation (and vice versa). 

3b) What does your consistency experiment show?
My consistency experiment shows that all usernames appeared immediately on the other instance (0 missing). This means that Firestore's replication between regions is very fast. I think this is because by the time the /register request is completed, the /list request is  made. So the data is already synced/consistent across both instances. This also lines up with the latency data, where /register takes twice as long as /list.
