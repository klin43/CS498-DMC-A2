Implementation: 
- There are two VMs (us and europe) running on two different node.js servers. 
- Each server has code for endpoints /greeting, /register, /list, and /clear. The code for server.js was taken from code example on Canvas assignment. 
- Each server is connected by the same Firestore database. 
- A script called "latency.py" is used to measure latency in both region instances. I followed the instructions on Canvas to implement this script. 
- A script called "consistency.py" is used to demo eventual consistency. I followed the instructions on Canvas to implement this script. 

File structure: 
step4 
|__ consistency.py 
|__ latency.py 
|__ package.json
|__ package-lock.json
|__ node_modules

Note: I included the code from step 4 and server.js (step 1 & step 3)
