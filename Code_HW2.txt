I implemented the latency measurement script by following the directions on Canvas. The script measures the average latency of the /register and /list endpoints from both region instances. 

I hardcoded the instance URLs as global variables. Then, I followed the given pseudocode: 
For each endpoint on each region: 
- Send 10 requests to the endpoint 
- Record the start time when sending the request 
- Record the end time after request is received 
- Calculate the time taken to complete each request and store it in an array
- Calculate and print the average latency for that region and endpoint  

The /register endpoint sends a POST request with a unique username to avoid duplication. The /list endpoint sends a GET request. 

The main() function calls the helper function, measure_latency(), for both endpoints on both regions. 
 
NOTE: I also followed the directions on Canvas to implement the “eventual consistency” script. I uploaded the code for both scripts and server.js (Node.js) file from step 1 and 3.
