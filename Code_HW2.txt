Implementation: 
- There are two VMs (us and europe) running on two different node.js servers. 
- Each server has code for endpoints /greeting, /register, /list, and /clear. 
- Each server is connected by the same Firestore database. 
- A script called "latency.py" is used to measure latency in both region instances. 
- A script called "consistency.py" is used to demo eventual consistency. 

File structure:

|__ package-lock.json
